2. Golden Gate bridge problem:
How many Legos would it take to rebuild the Golden Gate Bridge?
Assuming that I have modern technology at my disposal… I would use the internet to see if anyone else has tackled this problem. Seeking inspiration would speed up the process rather than reinventing the wheel. Not much was found in this area, so I moved on with my own thought process.
1.	What are the dimensions of a standard 2 x 4 Lego brick?
Unfortunately I no longer own any Legos, so my best source of this information is the web.
http://www.mapageweb.umontreal.ca/cousined/lego/3-Physics/Measurement/index.htm
My resource tells me that a brick’s measurement is 3.2cm x 1.6cm x .96cm (Excluding the raised notches that hold the pieces together). This equals a volume of 4.9152cm3
2.	What are the dimensions of the Golden Gate Bridge?
A great resource that I found pieced the bridge out to its multiple parts…
http://goldengatebridge.org/research/factsGGBDesign.php
For example the main towers, suspended wiring, anchors, etc. The main distinctions here are between concrete and steel structures. According to the site… the aggregation of concrete is 297,475m3. Converted to cm3 that is 2.975x1011 cm³. Steel on the other hand is reported in kg which need to be converted to cm3 as well. The aggregation of steel is reported to be 75,293,000kg. Making an assumption that the steel’s density is a uniform 7850kg/m3 we can calculate the steel to be 9,591,464,968.1529cm³.
3.	Final Calculations:

Based on public data, assumptions, and standardization of units. We have a bridge with a material volume of 9.591x109 cm3. Dividing that material volume by the volume of a single 2 x 4 Lego brick results in 1,951,293,940.

Thus my total rough estimate is 1,951,293,940 Lego Bricks.
